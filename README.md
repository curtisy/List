# Lists
Lists made in school written in Java using BlueJ as base GUI.
There are two types of lists:
Number one is a hierarchic list and can currently add nodes to a list and see if a specified node is within the list.
Number two is a simple linked list with many functions as adding and deleting nodes, checking if empty or a specific node is in the list etc. It also includes a basic Mergesort algorithm.
